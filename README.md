# Social Network API

 ## Description

 This application was created to demonstrate the structure and functionality of the back-end of an social network.  This application utilizes a MongoDB NOSQL database and Mongoose to map MongoDBâ€™s document representations of data to a virtual object database.  In this application, you can add, delete and update users,the user's friends, and the user's thoughts.  You can also add or delete reactions to the user's thoughts.  If you delete a user, all of the user's thoughts are also automatically deleted from the database.
